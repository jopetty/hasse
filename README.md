# Hasse

A little web app to create LaTeX Hasse diagrams from a list of ranking arguments.

## Intended Interface

I am writing this for use in the context of Optimality Theory in Phonology.

Input should be a list of constraint rankings:
```
Agree(Voice) >> Ident(Voice)
*en >> Max
*en >> Ident(Voice)
```
